# Storage Audit System

A production-inspired storage operation audit system built with Python and SQLite —
designed to simulate real QA workflows in enterprise storage environments.

Tracks every storage operation, classifies failures, and generates audit reports
for QA teams to identify issues and prioritize fixes.

## Features

- **AuditLogger** — records CREATE, READ, WRITE, DELETE operations with user and status
- **AuditReporter** — generates summaries, failure reports, and user activity
- **13 automated tests** — insertion, filtering, counting, reporting
- **In-memory SQLite** — fully isolated tests, no file cleanup needed
- **Bash scripts** — Unix-style DB setup and report generation
- **SQL Injection protection** — parameterized queries throughout

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uriel-P-V/storage-audit-system.git
cd storage-audit-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env

# Initialize database
bash scripts/setup_db.sh

# Insert sample data
python scripts/seed_db.py
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest

# By marker
pytest -m smoke
pytest -m critical
pytest -m regression
```

---

## Audit Report

```bash
bash scripts/audit_report.sh
```

Output example:

```
========================================
  Storage Audit Report
  DB: audit.db
========================================
  Total operations : 7
  Successful       : 4
  Failed           : 3
  Pass rate        : 57.1%

  --- Recent Failures ---
  [CREATE] /vol/backup by admin — Disk full
  [WRITE]  /vol/backup by system — Disk full
  [DELETE] /vol/temp by uriel — Permission denied

  --- Top Paths with Failures ---
  /vol/backup — 2 failure(s)
  /vol/temp — 1 failure(s)
========================================
```

## Agile Workflow

- Features developed in **feature branches**
- Code reviewed via **Pull Requests** before merging
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **SQLite** — embedded database, no server required
- **Pytest** — test framework with fixtures and markers
- **Bash** — Unix scripting for DB management and reporting
